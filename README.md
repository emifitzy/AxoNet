# AxoNet: Optic Nerve Axon Counting with U-Nets

This code was used to train the AxoNet convolutional neural network, which is packaged into a user-friendly Fiji plugin [here](https://github.com/matthew-ritch/AxoNet-fiji).
To watch the model train on the dataset, run main.py and sit back.

## Dependencies
Python 3, matplotlib, numpy, skimage, PIL, scipy, keras, and tensorflow.  
We recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for dependency management
